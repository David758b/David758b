Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!</br>
I may be a koala with a brain running on eucalyptus leaves and naps, but I love to code (when I’m awake, that is 😴). </br>
Just like how I munch on leaves all day, I nibble on bits of code—slow but steady!</br>
My natural habitat? The trees (and by trees, I mean the GitHub commit history 🌳📊).</br>
When I’m not coding, I’m either sleeping or figuring out how to get more snacks.

If you're ready for a chill collab or just want to share some fresh coding leaves, you're in the right place! 🐨
